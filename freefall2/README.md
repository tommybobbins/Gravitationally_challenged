Experiment to measure the acceleration due to gravity based on a ball bearing falling.

LDR/LED is triggered when the ball bearing passes between the LED and the LDR at the end of the marble run. This starts the clock counting.
Timer ends when the vibration sensor is trigerred when the bb hits the ramp. The vibration sensor is checked for a changed state. Vibration sensor used is a MS24P/10 from Comus (Assemtech).

Gravitational value is displayed on a converted 10mA FSD English Electric Ammeter with a 570 Ohm resistor.
